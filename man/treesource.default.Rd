\title{Mapping the tree clustering solution to a known source of variation underlying the forest}
\usage{
\method{treesource}{default}(clusterforest, solution)
}
\arguments{
\item{clusterforest}{The clusterforest object}

\item{solution}{The solution}
}
\description{
A function that can be used to get insight into a clusterforest solution, in the case that there is a known
source of variation underlying the forest.
It visualizes the number of trees from each source that belong to each cluster.
